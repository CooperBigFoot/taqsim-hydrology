# Sources

## Purpose

Source implementations provide inflow generation for `Source` nodes in taqsim networks. They define how external water inputs (rainfall-runoff, snowmelt, baseflow) are computed or loaded.

See [taqsim node types documentation](../../taqsim_docs/nodes/06_node_types.md) for how Source nodes integrate into the simulation.

## Planned Implementations

| Model | Module | Description | Status |
|-------|--------|-------------|--------|
| Precompute | `taqsim_hydrology.sources.precompute` | Pre-computed inflow timeseries from external models | Not implemented |
